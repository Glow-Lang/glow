;; TODO:
;; - In the near future, a strategy will not be a linear list of consecutive passes,
;;   but an arbitrary DAG with meets and joins and multiple final outputs,
;;   especially due to End-Point Projection. We ought to support that.
;; - Also, some passes can be enabled or disabled (which supposes the input layer(s) are a subset
;;   of the output layer(s), so the pass can be pass-through), or parameterized, such that
;;   test vectors will depend on parameters passed to the strategy.
;;   Each individual parameter and/or collection of parameters be a "layer".
;; - In a further future, the "layers" below will be themselves types of the pass functions,
;;   and a "strategy" is a well-typed diagram written by composing these functions,
;;   all in a typed combinator language that still allows enough introspection for debugging,
;;   selection and inspection of the output, plus, hopefully, proof of correctness.
;; - Current "ancillary data" should be made of such "layers" too, using dependent types
;;   to describe how it relates to the "main" data.
