;; Forward-analysis of *static* flow through variables within each scope of the program.
;; Insert checkpoints in the program from the beginning onward, and for each checkpoint, establish:
;; - What is the set of variables in scope so far at this checkpoint.
;; - What is the set of potential next / previous checkpoints from / to a given one,
;;   are for each pair, what are the relevant side-effects between them?
;;   Effects:
;;   - setting the active user to some variable (which causes a new checkpoint unless idempotent)
;;   - choice between multiple things
;;   - product/sum of publish, deposit or withdrawal statements
;;   - potential failure (maybe)
;;   - non-atomicity (maybe)
;;   - declaring a new variable
;;
;; We have to deal with multiple possible checkpoints in the past, because,
;; in the continuation of a switch wherein some cases contain checkpoints,
;; the previous checkpoint may be one of many things.
;; OR, do we then want to then always insert a checkpoint at the continuation point
;; that joins back after the switch (if non-tail, non-linear-survivor; can be inlined back later if linear)?
;; This prevents exponential explosion from iterated switches (checkpoint|no-checkpoint).
;; If we also insert a named checkpoint at the point of every switch, we might have a strict
;; separation between sum nodes and product nodes.
;; In either case, to each / to the only past checkpoint, the forward analysis information will associate:
;;
;; Question: when calling subroutines, should we have transition
;; to the called routine or to the return point, or both?
;; Or should we have two different kinds of transitions, "static" and "dynamic"?
