# *Glow*'s predecessor: Alacrity

Alacrity was an early prototype based on the same general ideas as *Glow*,
designed by the same author but built by a different team in a previous startup.
*Glow* is a complete rewrite that takes the design further:
the language has evolved in many directions,
and the implementation includes an application runtime
that can actually run the interactions on the blockchain.

### Website and Github repository

* Alacrity had a website [alacrity](https://alacrity-lang.org/)
  at its launch in September 2019, but we took it down in December 2020.
* The code is still visible for all to see in its
  [github repository](https://github.com/AlacrisIO/alacrity).

### Previous whitepapers

We released this whitepaper:
* [Legicash FaCTS: Fast Cryptocurrency Transactions, Securely](https://j.mp/FaCTS), our original Whitepaper, released March 2018. It focused on a scaling solution that we may some day implement. Some of the underlying ideas included foundations for the techniques used in Glow.

We wrote but never completed and released these two whitepapers:
* [Alacris Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5JoanOuPETu-mMd90kiNYA8Okh-fkhI18RI8kwq5l8/), July 2019 (first draft completed, never released), also focused on scaling, though with many of the ideas of the language.
* [Legicash: Binding Blockchains Together through Smart Law](https://j.mp/legicash), January 2018 (draft, never completed, never released), a document that is difficult to read, with plenty of technical ideas that explore the power and the limits of the analogy between legal contracts and smart contracts.
