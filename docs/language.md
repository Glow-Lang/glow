The base language is a statically typed pure functional dialect of JavaScript,
with some inspiration from ReasonML.

We add kinds of assertions:

  * `require!` checks at runtime a predicate holds and if not fails the active user's transaction.
    The predicate must be computable at runtime by all the parties using their common knowledge,
    so that the contract may verify it.
    The Glow compiler will reject the program unless it can prove that
    the assertion is indeed satisfiable for the active user,
    and generate code that satisfies the assertion.
    If some of the data comes from user input,
    it is the user's responsibility to provide data satisfying the predicate in a timely fashion.
    Informally, `require!` means "if this fails, the active user is at fault".

  * `assert!` checks at compile-time that the predicate always hold no matter what,
    as long as this point in the program was reached while the current user and the contract
    indeed run code generated by the Glow compiler,
    and the underlying infrastructure runs within the allowed parameters.
    Informally, `assert!` means "if this fails, the program won't even start."

  * `assume!` means that either the active user (within an `@A`) or everyone (outside an `@A`)
    assume the given hypothesis.
    Informally, `assume!` means "you must not run this program unless you know this to be true."
