# Bibliography about other Relevant Technology

"You can save hours reading papers with months of hard work on your project."

This document has plenty of pointers to other technology outside of Glow.
Mostly useful for people implementing or designing Glow,
or who want to understand the wider context.

TODO: Move everything to the wiki???

  BLS signatures are slightly more expensive to check but only take O(n) messages and so scale to larger number of participants.
