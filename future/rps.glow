// Generates JS code like
//   let Hand = Enum("Rock", "Paper", "Scissors");
// Implicity generates the thing on the right:
//   Hand.get               inputHand    inputs the user a Hand
//   Hand.is_element        isHand       checks whether it's a Hand
//   Hand.toNat             HandToNat    converts a Hand to a Nat
//   Hand.fromNat           NatToHand    converts a Nat to a Hand // only available contract-side if the constructors have no parameters?
//   Hand.values.Rock       Rock         typed constant value
//   Hand.values.Paper      Paper        typed constant value
//   Hand.values.Scissors   Scissors     typed constant value
